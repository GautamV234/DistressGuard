# DistressGuard

DistressGuard is an Android/iOS app designed to provide a reliable ICE (In Case of Emergency) alert system. This repository contains the source code and project files for the DistressGuard mobile application. The app enables users to trigger distress signals when they move outside a pre-defined geographic perimeter. It establishes a secure network connection between two devices and facilitates the transmission of pre-recorded distress audio messages, along with real-time GPS location data. Additionally, the app allows the alert recipient to remotely activate the distressed person's microphone for situational awareness and timely assistance.

## Files

The following files are included in the project:

- `file_1.slx`: [Contains the fundamental widgets built on Simulink]
- `ICE_assignment.slx`: [Contains the integrated final code joining the sender and reciever]
- `reciever.slx`: [Contains the structured block diagram for the sender]
- `sender.slx`: [Contains the structured block diagram for the reciever]

## Features

- Define a pre-defined geographic perimeter for triggering emergencies.
- Establish a secure network connection using TCP/IP or UDP protocols.
- Transmit pre-recorded distress audio messages from the distressed person's device (Phone A) to the recipient's device (Phone B).
- Share real-time GPS location data of the distressed person with the recipient.
- Remotely activate the microphone on the distressed person's device for situational awareness.
- Bidirectional functionality for distress signal exchange between Phone A and Phone B.
